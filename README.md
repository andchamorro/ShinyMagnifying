## Introduction {#introduction}

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized biomedical research by offering high-resolution insights into cellular heterogeneity and gene expression variability. However, analyzing scRNA-seq data can be challenging due to its complexity, sparsity, and high dimensionality. ShinyMagnifying addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive set of functionalities for scRNA-seq data analysis through an intuitive web-based interface.

## Features {#features}

-   **Basic Analysis Workflow**: Perform standard scRNA-seq data analysis steps.
-   **Gene Ontology (GO) Analysis**: Conduct GO analysis to understand the biological significance of gene sets.
-   [ ] **Cell Type Annotation**: Annotate cell types based on gene expression profiles.
-   [ ] **Trajectory/Pseudo-time Analysis**: Analyze cell differentiation trajectories and pseudo-time.
-   [ ] **Network Construction**: Build gene co-expression networks.
-   [ ] **Alignment-Free Expression Quantification**: Quantify gene expression without alignment.

## Installation {#installation}

To install ShinyMagnifying, you need to have R and Shiny installed on your system. You can install ShinyMagnifying from GitHub using the following commands:

``` r
# Install devtools if you haven't already
install.packages("devtools")

```

## Usage {#usage}

After installation, you can launch the ShinyMagnifying app with the following command:

``` r
library(ShinyMagnifying)
runApp()
```

### Basic Analysis Workflow

-   Load Data: Import your scRNA-seq raw data.
-   Preprocessing: Perform quality control, normalization, and scaling.
-   Dimensionality Reduction: Apply PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP for dimensionality reduction.
-   Clustering: Identify cell clusters using various clustering algorithms.
-   Visualization: Visualize the results using interactive plots. \### Gene Ontology (GO) Analysis- Select Gene Sets: Choose gene sets of interest.
-   [ ] Run GO Analysis: Perform GO analysis to identify enriched biological processes.
-   [ ] Visualize Results: Display the results in interactive plots. \### Cell Type Annotation- Load Reference Data: Import reference datasets for cell type annotation.
-   [ ] Annotate Cells: Use marker genes to annotate cell types.
-   [ ] Review Annotations: Manually review and adjust annotations if necessary. \### Trajectory/Pseudo-time Analysis- Select Cells: Choose cells for trajectory analysis.
-   [ ] Run Analysis: Perform trajectory or pseudo-time analysis.
-   [ ] Visualize Trajectories: Display the trajectories in interactive plots. \### Network Construction- Select Genes: Choose genes for network construction.
-   [ ] Build Network: Construct gene co-expression networks.
-   [ ] Visualize Networks: Display the networks in interactive plots.
